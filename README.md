# Overlapping circles, Milano

Milan is a vortex of overlapping circles, a social ecosystem where personal geography meets collective passion. Overlapping Circles transforms the city into a digital web, mapping the intersections of clubbing, food, and chill. Through this Obsidian vault, Milan reveals itself as a "village pretending to be a city," where shared interests weave a network of recurring faces. This project maps frequented nodes—from techno sets to urban corners—unveiling a city where everyone is ultimately linked. It is a blueprint of urban interconnection.
